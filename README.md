# SCT_CS_1
A modern Python application with a clean Graphical Interface (GUI) to encrypt and decrypt using the Caeser Cipher Algorithm.
Built with Tkinter, this tool is beginner-friendly, visually intuitive, and packed with helpful features.

## What is a Caeser Cipher?
The Caeser Cipher is a substitution cipher where each character in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places the character set. 
This project goes beyond just the alphabet and supports the entire printable ASCII set, making it much more robust and versatile than the traditional version.

## Features
- Encrypt and decrypt text using the Caeser Cipher Logic
- Simple, clean, and user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter
- Mode of selection is done using radio buttons
- The encrypted/decrypted result to copied to clipboard
- One-Click Clear All functionality
- Validations for the input messages and shift value and helpful error messages
- Read-Only result box to prevent accidental edits from the user

### Prerequisites
